#[Academic thesis 2012][Rasmus Berg Palm]Prediction as a candidate for learning deep hierarchical models of data

#Please use 'nn_demo_separation.m' and 'mfnn_demo_separation.m' to run each task for source separation.
#Note if use mfnn, you may need to use layerwise training.
#In MFNN, you need the file 'OLA.m' to do inverse STFT. I only put it in the NN folder, please copy it to the MFNN folder.
